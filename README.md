## Hi there 👋

Hey 😃 I'm Titir, a Graduate student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Stevens Institute of Technology. I'm building a career at the intersection of Robotics, AI Infrastructure, and Human-Centered Design—focusing on tech that directly improves human lives.

💻 Academic Focus: Currently maintaining a near-perfect track record in Deep Learning (AAI 628) and Pattern Recognition (AAI 646). I'm fascinated by the math of neural networks and their application in real-world data acquisition.

🔭 Current Research: I am currently co-authoring a paper titled "Mapping the Future of Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure: A Machine Learning Approach to Locating Data Centers." We’ve developed a ML-driven framework to optimize data center siting by balancing energy, risk, and policy.

🧠 Design Philosophy: I believe the best AI is "Human-Centered." My goal is to bridge the gap between complex robotics and intuitive, purposeful user experiences.

🏆 Recent Projects: From predictive algorithms to deep learning models, I love building systems that solve high-stakes problems in healthcare and infrastructure.

📚 Interests: When I'm not training models, I'm likely caught up in Webtoons or a good book.

⚡ Fun Fact: I have a serious sweet tooth 🍰 (always looking for the best dessert spots!).
